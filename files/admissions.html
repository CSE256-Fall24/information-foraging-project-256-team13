                    <p>
                      An application fee of $40 is required when applying to the nursery
                      school. After this is received, your child is placed on an enrollment
                      list. You will be notified of acceptance in the March preceding the
                      fall enrollment date. Upon acceptance, a nonrefundable deposit of one
                      month’s tuition is due. This will be applied to tuition for the
                      following May.
