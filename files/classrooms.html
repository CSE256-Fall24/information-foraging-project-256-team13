        Washington University Nursery School teachers are attentive to
        individual needs, serving as catalysts to spark each child’s interests
        and desire to experiment and explore. Our school provides a safe,
        nurturing environment that encourages growth and independence in all
        developmental areas.

       The nursery school philosophy emphasizes learning through play with a hands-on approach that values the process over the product. 
       Teachers tailor the curriculum to each class’s interests and abilities, and children engage with specialists in science,
        art, music, and Spanish. We also evaluate new trends to enhance the program.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The staff values the unique talents of each child, family, and teacher, encouraging 
        teachers to develop their personal approach. This creates a vibrant, supportive community.
